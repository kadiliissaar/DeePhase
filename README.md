# DeePhase

DeePhase v1 (academic use only) predicts the propensity of proteins to undergo homotypic liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).

The repository includes the code associated with the paper "Learning the molecular grammar of protein condensates from sequence determinants and embeddings" (Saar et al. 2021, PNAS).


NB! If you are interested in using the predictor only, you can find all the relevant code in the "PREDICT" directory.
